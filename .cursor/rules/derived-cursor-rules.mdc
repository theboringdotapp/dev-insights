VISUALIZATION
- When adding new metrics to graphs, use a color that matches the brand. For reviews, use pastel orange, specifically `#fb923c` (Orange 400).
- When a chart displays multiple metrics, update the Y-axis label to be more generic to reflect all metrics shown. For example, change "PRs" to "PRs & Reviews".
